# Chess_by_me
I've created a simple chess game using python<br>
I have taken help from youtube and various sources while developing this as I was facing different bugs but after many hours of understanding those bugs I successfully fixed them.<br>
This game doesn't have a auto multiplayer so you have to play from both sides of the game ðŸ˜…<br>
Don't worry in fututre I will try to make it auto multiplayer and also add a visible timer so you'll know how much time you left to play<br>
